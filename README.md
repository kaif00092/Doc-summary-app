```
### Install client dependencies:

```

cd frontend
npm install
```
### Run the Application
You'll need to run the frontend and backend in separate terminals.

Run the backend server:

The API should now be running on http://localhost:3030.

Run the frontend client (from the client directory):

# In /client
```
npm run dev
```
The React app should now be accessible at http://localhost:5173.
